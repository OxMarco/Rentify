# The Fluidifier

## Introduction
Created for the "Scaling Ethereum" hack, a marketplace for real estate properties based on Superfluid cashflow system
entirely running on layer 2 for cheaper prices and faster transactions.

## Usage
A landlord can navigate to the *Sell* area of the website and list a property by adding all relevant data and define a price per month.
A rentee can then sift through the current properties to let using a map filter and choose one: upon finalisation a new stream
is generated and the rentee starts immediately paying.

## Run
To run it, first install dependencies with
*yarn install*
and then 
*yarn start*
